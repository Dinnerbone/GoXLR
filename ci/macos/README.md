# MacOS CI Handlers

The files in this directory are primarily to aid in creation of a `.pkg` file for MacOS installation of the utility.

To aid in use in an IDE, `.plist` files have been given the `.xml` extension, during CI (via `build-macos-package`) 
they are renamed to `.plist` to confirm with the Apple standard.
